# Knowledge Base Alternatives for Replit

Since Docker isn't available in the Replit environment, here are better alternatives:

## Option 1: Built-in Simple Knowledge Base
Create a file-based knowledge base using Markdown files and a simple interface:
- Store documentation as Markdown files
- Build a simple React interface to browse and search
- Use your existing PostgreSQL to store metadata
- Much lighter weight and perfectly integrated

## Option 2: External Wiki.js Hosting
- Deploy Wiki.js on a service like Railway, Heroku, or DigitalOcean
- Connect to it via API or iframe from your portal
- More robust but requires external hosting

## Option 3: Notion/Confluence Integration
- Use Notion's API to display documentation
- Much easier to manage content
- Professional knowledge management features

## Recommendation: Built-in Solution
The best approach for your Replit environment is to build a simple, integrated knowledge base that:
- Uses your existing database
- Stores content as Markdown
- Provides search and organization
- Matches your portal's design perfectly
- No external dependencies or Docker required
