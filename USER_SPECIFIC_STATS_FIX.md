# User-Specific Dashboard Stats Fix

## Problem Identified
Dashboard metric cards were showing the same data for all users instead of user-specific data. When Amanda logged in, she was seeing Jon's pipeline data instead of her own.

## Root Cause Analysis
The API endpoint was correctly filtering by user email on the backend, but the frontend caching system wasn't properly isolating data between users.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. User-Specific Query Keys
- **Before**: `queryKey: ['/api/dashboard/metrics']` (same for all users)
- **After**: `queryKey: ['/api/dashboard/metrics', user?.email]` (unique per user)
- **Result**: Each user gets their own cached metrics data

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Guards
- Added `enabled: !!user?.email` to prevent queries when user not authenticated
- Ensures metrics only load when user is properly logged in

### 3. Complete Cache Clearing
- **Login**: Clear all cached data to prevent cross-user contamination
- **Logout**: Use `queryClient.clear()` to remove ALL cached data
- **Result**: No data leakage between user sessions

## Verification from Logs
```
Jon's session: Pipeline Value: $62,465, Active Deals: 5, MTD Revenue: $8,420
Amanda's session: Pipeline Value: $0, Active Deals: 0, MTD Revenue: $0
```

This confirms the fix is working - each user sees only their own HubSpot deal data.

## Technical Details

### Backend (Already Working Correctly)
```javascript
// server/routes.ts - Dashboard metrics endpoint
app.get("/api/dashboard/metrics", requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  const metrics = await hubSpotService.getDashboardMetrics(req.user.email);
  res.json(metrics);
});
```

### Frontend Fixes Applied
```javascript
// client/src/hooks/useDashboardMetrics.ts
export function useDashboardMetrics() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['/api/dashboard/metrics', user?.email], // User-specific key
    enabled: !!user?.email, // Only run when authenticated
    // ... other options
  });
}
```

### Authentication Improvements
```javascript
// client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx
onSuccess: async (user: SelectUser) => {
  // Clear all cached data to prevent cross-user data leakage
  await queryClient.invalidateQueries();
  // Force fresh fetch
  await queryClient.refetchQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/user"] });
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ Each user now sees only their own pipeline value, active deals, and MTD revenue
- ✅ Complete data isolation between user sessions
- ✅ No cache contamination when switching users
- ✅ Proper authentication guards to prevent unauthorized data access

The dashboard stats cards now correctly display user-specific data as intended!
