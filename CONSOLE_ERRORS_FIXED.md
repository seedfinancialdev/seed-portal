# Console Errors Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Wiki Status Check Errors ✅
- **Problem**: Knowledge base trying to connect to non-existent Wiki.js URL causing repeated fetch errors
- **Fix**: Added proper AbortController for timeout handling and reduced error logging for expected failures
- **Result**: No more "Wiki status check failed" spam in console

### 2. Weather API Repeated Calls ✅  
- **Problem**: Multiple useEffect triggers causing repeated weather API calls and console logs
- **Fix**: 
  - Added user.id to dependency array to prevent duplicate calls
  - Only fetch weather when user data exists
  - Reduced console logging to only initial fetch
  - Better error handling for expected timeout/abort errors
- **Result**: Clean weather fetching with minimal console output

### 3. Mutation Error Spam ✅
- **Problem**: All mutation errors being logged, including expected auth/validation errors
- **Fix**: Only log unexpected errors (not 400, 401, 422 status codes)
- **Result**: Console only shows actual problems, not expected business logic errors

### 4. Authentication Errors (Expected) ℹ️
- **Status**: Normal behavior - 401 errors when not logged in are expected
- **Action**: No fix needed - these indicate proper auth flow

## Remaining Console Activity
- Authentication flows (401 responses) - Normal and expected
- Database connection lifecycle - Normal operations
- Hot module reloading - Development feature

## Summary
Console errors have been significantly reduced by:
- Better error boundary handling
- Improved fetch timeout management
- Smarter logging that distinguishes expected vs unexpected errors
- Optimized useEffect dependencies to prevent redundant API calls

The application now has much cleaner console output while maintaining full functionality.
