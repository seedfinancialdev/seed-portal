# Google Workspace Admin API Setup Instructions

## CRITICAL: Client Secret Required

Your Google Workspace Admin API integration is 99% complete, but I need your **client_secret** to finish the setup.

### Step 1: Get Your Client Secret
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**  
3. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (ID: `537178633862-...`)
4. Copy the **Client Secret** value (it looks like: `GOCSPX-...` or similar)

### Step 2: Provide the Secret
Once you have the client_secret, I'll update the ADC file and your Google Workspace Admin API will be fully functional.

### Current Status
✅ OAuth scopes obtained from Google OAuth Playground
✅ Refresh token configured
✅ ADC file structure created
❌ Client secret needed to complete authentication

### What This Enables
- **User Management Interface**: View all @seedfinancial.io users
- **Role Assignment**: Manually assign Admin/Sales/Service roles
- **Google Workspace Integration**: Real-time user data from your domain
- **Enterprise Controls**: Complete administrative oversight

The user management interface at `/user-management` is already built and ready to work once we complete this final step.
