## Overview
This project is a comprehensive Internal Employee Portal for Seed Financial, built with React, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. It aims to be a centralized command center, enhancing internal efficiency and client engagement. Key capabilities include a centralized dashboard, a sophisticated quote calculator (supporting 5 services: Bookkeeping, TaaS, Payroll, AP/AR Lite, FP&A Lite), a commission tracker, a client intelligence engine, and profile management. It integrates with HubSpot, provides real-time weather, address autocomplete, advanced sales analytics, and automates MSA document generation with Box integration for client folder management.
