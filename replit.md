## Overview

This is a comprehensive Seed Financial Internal Employee Portal built with React, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. The application features a centralized dashboard as the home page (/) with integrated tools including a sophisticated quote calculator (/calculator), commission tracker, client intelligence engine, and profile management. The portal provides HubSpot integration, real-time weather services, address autocomplete, and advanced sales analytics. The quote calculator now features a modern 5-service selection system (Bookkeeping, TaaS, Payroll, AP/AR Lite, FP&A Lite), enhanced client details with address collection, automated MSA document generation, and Box integration for client folder management. The overall vision is to create a centralized command center for all Seed Financial business operations, enhancing internal efficiency and client engagement.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Blue-themed sales dashboard, purple-themed service dashboard, SEEDOS branding with role-appropriate color themes, clean white sidebar with gray background for executive dashboard. Design emphasizes consistent navigation, prominent action cards, and clear typography (League Spartan for SeedKB, Open Sans for titles). Visual elements include glassmorphism effects, gradient backgrounds, and subtle hover animations.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Style**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend
- **Session Management**: Redis-backed sessions with connect-redis (falls back to memory store in development)
- **Security Middleware**: Helmet for security headers, CSRF protection with csurf
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Pino, request logging middleware
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry integration for production error monitoring
- **Rate Limiting**: Express-rate-limit on API endpoints

### System Design Choices
- **Authentication**: Google Workspace OIDC authentication, restricted to `@seedfinancial.io` email addresses, with multi-layer admin enforcement and manual role assignment. User management includes Google Admin API integration for user syncing.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented with Admin, Sales, and Service roles, controlling dashboard access, feature visibility, and functionality.
- **Data Integration Strategy**: Direct API integrations with third-party services. Future consideration for Apache Airbyte for unified data pipeline beyond 4-5 integrations.
- **Secret Management**: All secrets managed via environment variables (e.g., GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET) and never hardcoded or committed. ADC files are used for Google API authentication.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL as the primary database, using Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations.
- **Core Functionality**: Quote generation, commission tracking, client intelligence (HubSpot and OpenAI driven), user profile management, and a comprehensive Knowledge Base (SEEDKB).
- **AI Integration**: AI article generation with versioning, AI-powered client intelligence for prospect scoring and data enhancement, and AI features within SEEDKB (e.g., AI Search Copilot).
- **Error Handling & Resilience**: Enhanced database connection pooling, retry logic for transient failures, graceful error handling for external API calls, and comprehensive authentication system audits.
- **Workflow & User Experience**: Iterative development focusing on streamlining user flows, enhancing login experience, providing clear navigation, and offering rich visual feedback (e.g., toast notifications, scroll restoration, counter animations).
