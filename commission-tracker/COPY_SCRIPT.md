# Easy File Copy Instructions

## Method 1: Download and Upload (Recommended)

1. **In your current project (seed-bk-calc):**
   - Click the three dots menu (â‹®) next to any file
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - This downloads your entire project

2. **Extract and copy:**
   - Unzip the downloaded file
   - Navigate to the `commission-tracker` folder
   - Select all contents inside this folder

3. **In your new project (seed-commission-tracker):**
   - Delete the default `main.py` or any starter files
   - Drag and drop all the commission-tracker contents into the file tree
   - OR use "Upload file" button to upload everything

## Method 2: Manual File Creation

I can help you create each file one by one. Just tell me which file you want me to create first, and I'll show you the exact content to copy-paste.

Start with these essential files in order:
1. `package.json`
2. `.replit` 
3. `vite.config.ts`
4. `tsconfig.json`
5. `drizzle.config.ts`

Then we'll do the folders:
- `shared/` folder files
- `server/` folder files  
- `client/` folder files

## Method 3: GitHub Upload (If Available)

If your new Replit connects to GitHub:
1. Push the commission-tracker folder to a GitHub repo
2. Import that repo into your new Replit

Which method would you prefer? I can walk you through any of these step by step.
