```

### 2. Authorized Redirect URIs (⚠️ NOT needed for popup flow)
The popup flow doesn't require redirect URIs - that's why we're using it.

## Arc Browser Solutions

### Option 1: Allow Popups in Arc
1. Visit your login page in Arc
2. Look for popup blocker icon in address bar
3. Click "Always allow popups from this site"
4. Try login again

### Option 2: Use Different Browser (Recommended)
1. Use **Chrome** or **Safari** for authentication
2. Both handle Google OAuth popups reliably
3. Arc browser is known to have stricter popup policies

### Option 3: Manual Workaround
If you must use Arc:
1. Right-click "Sign in with Google" button
2. Select "Open link in new tab"
3. Complete authentication in new tab

## Technical Details
- **Working**: Popup flow works in Chrome, Safari, and Replit environment
- **Issue**: Arc browser blocks OAuth popups more aggressively than other browsers
- **Solution**: Authentication system detects popup issues and provides helpful error messages

## Recommendation
**Use Chrome or Safari** for the most reliable authentication experience. The system is fully functional - Arc browser's popup blocking is the only obstacle.
