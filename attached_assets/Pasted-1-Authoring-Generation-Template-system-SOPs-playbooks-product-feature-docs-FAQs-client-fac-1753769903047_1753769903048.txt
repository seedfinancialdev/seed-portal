1) Authoring & Generation
	•	Template system
SOPs, playbooks, product/feature docs, FAQs, client-facing guides. Template variables (e.g., {{industry}}, {{state}}, {{entity_type}}) and reusable snippets (“Disclaimers,” “Billing section,” etc.).
	•	Structured front-matter
Title, audience (internal/client), lifecycle stage (Draft/Review/Approved), owners, review date, tags, compliance flags. Enforced as JSON/YAML at the top of each doc.
	•	Outline → Draft → Polish workflow
“Plan first” mode (headings + bullets), then expansion, then a polish pass (tone, examples, links).
	•	Audience toggles
Switch between Internal, Client-friendly, and Sales-ready versions from one source of truth.
	•	Channel-aware rendering
Export to Markdown (docs site), HTML (CMS/Help Center), PDF, and short “playcard” summaries for HubSpot/Slack.
	•	Multilingual (optional)
Human-in-the-loop translation with glossary enforcement.
	•	Diagram & table helpers
Mermaid/PlantUML from text; CSV-to-table; auto-sizing comparison tables.

2) Knowledge & Context (RAG that actually behaves)
	•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Vector search over “knowledge cards” (chunked SOPs, policies, pricing, glossary, tone guide). Top-K + re-rank + freshness bias.
	•	Source control
“Only answer from approved sources” mode; per-repo/per-folder include/exclude.
	•	Citations & traceability
Inline citations with deep links; evidence panel with confidence and last-updated dates.
	•	Auto cross-links & taxonomy
Detects entities and inserts [Related Docs] and glossary hovers; maintains a graph of dependencies.

⸻

3) Quality, Compliance & Guardrails
	•	Style guide enforcement
Lint for voice (witty, not flippant), banned terms, reading level, tense/person. Scored “Brand Fit 1–5”.
	•	Compliance rails
PII/PHI/PCI detection & redaction; required disclaimers by doc type; state-by-state caveats. “No new legal advice” rule.
	•	Factuality checks
Claim-evidence matching (hallucination guard), numeric sanity checks, date recency flags.
	•	Schema validation
Ensures required sections exist (e.g., “Risks,” “Action Checklist,” “Last Reviewed”).

⸻

4) Collaboration & Workflow
	•	PR-style reviews
Suggested edits, inline comments, approver lanes (SME → Compliance → Brand).
	•	Tasks & notifications
ClickUp issues from failed checks; Slack/Email for “needs approvals,” “doc expiring,” “policy changed.”
	•	Change proposals
“Propose update” button for anyone; routed to the right owner with the relevant context pulled in.

⸻

5) Continuous Learning (Self-training without drift)
	•	Edit-diff capture
Every human edit is logged as a labeled improvement: style, accuracy, structure, compliance.
	•	Feedback signals → retriever
Boost sources that repeatedly survive editing; down-rank those that cause fixes. Nightly vector refresh.
	•	Prompt & rubric versioning
Versioned system prompts and checklists; A/B outputs; rollback button.
	•	Curated fine-tune (optional, quarterly)
Train on high-scoring docs + their before/after diffs to nudge base behavior.
