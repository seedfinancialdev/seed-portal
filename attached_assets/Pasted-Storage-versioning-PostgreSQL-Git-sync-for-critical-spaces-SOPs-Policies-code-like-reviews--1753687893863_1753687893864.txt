Storage & versioning: PostgreSQL + Git sync for critical spaces (SOPs/Policies) → code-like reviews and rollbacks.
	•	Permissions model (keep it simple):
	•	Readers: Everyone @ Seed.
	•	Contributors: Function teams (Tax, Bookkeeping, CFO, Sales, Ops).
	•	Maintainers: Team leads (approve/publish).
	•	Admins: Ops + 1 backup.
	•	Search: turn on full-text + synonyms (e.g., “QBO” = “QuickBooks”), alias common tax jargon, highlight result snippets.
	•	Analytics: enable page + search analytics; create a weekly “content debt” report.
	•	Backups: daily DB snapshots + weekly Git mirror; retention 30/90 days.

Editorial workflow
	•	Content types (use page templates + labels): SOP, Playbook, Runbook, Policy, How-to, Checklist, ADR (Decision Record), Template, FAQ, Reference.
	•	Lifecycle: Draft → Review → Publish → Auto-stale at 90 days → Re-review. Owners are required for every top-200 page.
	•	Change safety: PR-style review for SOPs/Policies; lightweight review for How-tos/FAQs.

Brand & tone
	•	Headings that sound like you: “What this is,” “Good fit / Not a fit,” “Time-savers,” “Gotchas,” “Receipts (evidence/links).”
	•	Microcopy: witty, never snarky. Finance, but make it human.

3) Information Architecture (opinionated, scalable)

Top-level spaces (keep to ~10). Each space uses the same sub-structure so no one gets lost.
	1.	Services (Your “APIs”)
	•	TaaS (Tax-as-a-Service)
	•	What it is, scope, SLAs, engagement flow, Tax SWAT Hotline playbook, state nexus matrix, filing calendars, letters/templates, multi-state workflows, audit response kits, R&D credits guide.
	•	Bookkeeping
	•	QBO setup, monthly close checklist, reconciliations, cleanup playbook, KPI definitions, dashboard standards.
	•	Fractional CFO
	•	Rolling 13-week cash, budget templates, scenario models, board pack format, fundraising data room checklist.
	•	White-Label Back Office

	•	Add-ons
	•	Payroll (Gusto) playbook, sales-tax automation matrix, entity restructuring checklist.
	2.	Client Operations (Delivery Machine)
	•	Intake & onboarding (HubSpot → ClickUp handoff), data fetch automation, client comms SLAs, renewal/upsell moments.
	•	Monthly/Quarterly rhythms: close calendar, pre-close tasks, variance analysis workflow, review/approval.

	•	Standard Chart of Accounts by vertical, revenue recognition nuances, common KPIs, typical pitfalls, sample reports.
	4.	Chart of Accounts (CoA) Library

	10.	Glossary & KPI Library

Navigation principles
	•	Keep menu shallow (≤3 levels).
	•	Every space has a Start Here page + a Top 20 Tasks quick links page.
	•	Cross-link aggressively (especially to SOPs and templates).
	•	Tags: service/*, industry/*, stage/* (onboarding, close, review), tool/* (qbo, gusto, hubspot, clickup, n8n), type/*.
