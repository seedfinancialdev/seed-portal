ok now when the TaaS card is clicked - A new card appears with the same Core Fields as in Bookkeeping with the same input values if they were already started in bookkeeping. The following fields are after the core fields on this new card.

Entity Type (dropdown): LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp, Partnership, Sole Prop, Non-Profit

Number of Entities (number)

States Filed (number)

International Filing? (radio): Yes / No (FBAR, 5471 triggers)

Number of Business Owners (number)

Bookkeeping Quality (dropdown): Clean (Seed), Outside CPA, Messy

Include 1040s? (Yes/No) – charge $25 per owner if yes

Prior Years Unfiled (number): 0–5+

Already on Seed Bookkeeping? (Yes/No) – gets 10% discount

The logis is as follows:
base = 150;

entityUpcharge = numEntities === 1 ? 0 : numEntities <= 3 ? 75 : 150;
stateUpcharge = states <= 1 ? 0 : states <= 5 ? 50 : 150;
intlUpcharge = intl ? 200 : 0;
ownerUpcharge = numOwners <= 1 ? 0 : numOwners <= 3 ? 50 : 100;
bookUpcharge = bookQuality === 'Clean (Seed)' ? 0 : bookQuality === 'Outside CPA' ? 75 : 150;
personal1040 = include1040s ? numOwners * 25 : 0;

industryMult = {
'SaaS': 1.0, 'Agencies': 1.1, 'Real Estate': 1.2,
'E-commerce': 1.3, 'Construction': 1.4, 'Multi-entity': 1.5
}[industry];

revenueMult = avgMonthlyRevenue <= 10000 ? 1.0
: avgMonthlyRevenue <= 25000 ? 1.2
: avgMonthlyRevenue <= 75000 ? 1.4
: avgMonthlyRevenue <= 250000 ? 1.6
: avgMonthlyRevenue <= 1000000 ? 1.8
: 2.0;

rawFee = (base + entityUpcharge + stateUpcharge + intlUpcharge + ownerUpcharge + bookUpcharge + personal1040) * industryMult * revenueMult;

monthlyFee = Math.max(150, Math.round((isBookkeepingClient ? rawFee * 0.9 : rawFee) / 5) * 5);

the Prior Years Unfiled field corresponds to the Setup Fee
perYearFee = monthlyFee * 0.8 * 12;
setupFee = Math.max(monthlyFee, perYearFee * priorYearsUnfiled);

now keep in mind that if say a bookkeeping quote has already been created and we want to add TaaS, then these numbers should add on top of the numbers quoted in bookkeeping. also, we can make the breakdown area more comprehensive. and because its bound to be so long in this case, lets make it expandable where its collapsed by default
