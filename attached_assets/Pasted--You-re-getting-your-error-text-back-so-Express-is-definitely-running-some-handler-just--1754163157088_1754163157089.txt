### You‚Äôre getting *your* error text back, so **Express is definitely running some handler**‚Äîjust **not the one (or not the copy) that has your log lines.**

That means a duplicate route or a shadow ‚Äúfail-fast‚Äù middleware is registered **before** the one that prints logs.

Below is a focused way to prove where the POST is landing.

---

## 1. Dump every registered route at boot

Add *once*, right after all routes are mounted but before `app.listen()`:

```js
function listRoutes(app) {
  console.log('\nüó∫Ô∏è  ROUTE MAP ------------------------');
  app._router.stack
    .filter(r => r.route)                   // only routes, skip middleware
    .forEach(r => {
      const path = r.route?.path;
      const methods = Object.keys(r.route.methods).join(',').toUpperCase();
      console.log(`${methods.padEnd(7)} ${path}`);
    });
  console.log('------------------------------------\n');
}
listRoutes(app);
```

*Expected output snippet* (simplified):

```
POST    /api/quotes        <-- you expect ONE of these
POST    /api/quotes        <-- ‚ö†Ô∏è if you see a SECOND definition, that‚Äôs your phantom
GET     /api/quotes
```

If two **POST /api/quotes** entries appear, note their order; Express will hit the first one that matches.

---

## 2. Binary-search the duplicate

1. Comment-out the **router** you *think* is correct.

   * If the POST still returns your error text, you‚Äôve just confirmed a duplicate elsewhere.
2. Grep for `router.post('/api/quotes'` (or whatever relative path) across the project *including node\_modules* (sometimes generators stub extra files).
3. Remove or rename the duplicate, or change your mounting order:

```js
app.use('/api/quotes', myMainQuoteRouter);  // mount LAST so it wins
```

---

## 3. If no duplicate route in the dump‚Ä¶

### Check for an upstream proxy or edge-function

* If you‚Äôre on **Vercel**, see if a `vercel.json` or `middleware.ts` file rewrites `/api/quotes` to something else.
* If you run **Netlify Functions** or **Cloudflare Worker** on that path, same idea.

Add an **early Express catch-all** just above every other route:

```js
app.post('/api/quotes', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('üéØ REACHED CATCH-ALL in Express');
  next();
});
```

If you *still* don‚Äôt see the log, the request never reaches Node‚Äîit‚Äôs being short-circuited before Express (CDN function, Nginx rule, etc.).

---

## 4. What about caching middleware?

* Look for something like `apicache`, `lru-cache`, or a custom `memCache` that wraps `app.post(...)` calls.
* Those middlewares can ‚Äúremember‚Äù a previous 400/500 and reply instantly without hitting your handler or your tap.

Temporarily disable any cache layer and test again.

### Quick triage checklist

| Check                        | Command / action                           | Expected                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Route dump shows duplicates? | `npm run dev` ‚Äì read **üó∫Ô∏è ROUTE MAP**     | Exactly *one* `POST /api/quotes`      |
| Does catch-all log fire?     | Add snippet; POST again                    | See ‚ÄúüéØ REACHED CATCH-ALL in Express‚Äù |
| Still no log?                | Inspect Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare rewrites | Remove or rewrite rule                |
| Cache layer?                 | Comment out `cache()` middleware           | POST hits Express again               |

Fix whichever of those fires the red flag, then your `req.user.id` will flow into the **correct** handler and the quote will save.

---

**TL;DR:** The POST *is* hitting Express‚Äîbut an earlier copy of the route (or an upstream edge function) fires first and throws your ‚ÄúownerId null‚Äù error before your logger runs. Dump routes, remove the shadow, and you‚Äôre done.
